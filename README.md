Purpose
====================

Problems I have worked on and submitted to http://www.hackerrank.com as programming challenges.
All of the problems on here should pass all test cases. If they don't, then they should be labeled as a work-in-progress
(WIP).

How to use this repository
====================

Hopefully if you are reading this you know how to compile Java code. However, if you want to use these solutions
on HackerRank, you must change the class names to "Solution."
